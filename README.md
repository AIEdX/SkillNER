# SkillNER project 




## Project overview : 
- The goal of this project is to build a named entity extraction solution for skill extraction from job posting text .
- Our solution merge a rulebased matcher that label data and feed it. to aBERT model that we will fine tune for skills rcognition

## Documentation : 
Visit this [notion link](https://sudsy-dill-008.notion.site/f6596c10b49545d5a740e0ecc21a5a46?v=801ba1af94a0484d8af732347c211fb0) for updated documentation about the project 

## Collaborations 
- I add weekly new issues regarding skill extractor , choose an issue and lest start a conversation to fix it 
- If you wanna jump to code open notebooks/skills-extractor that contain all modules used to extract skills 
## Big Todos :
= prepare labled data by natcher for verification 
- configure NERDA package to fine tune BERT model

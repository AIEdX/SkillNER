Getting started
===============

It is easy to get started with **skillNer** and take advantage of its features. 
This starter guide will walk you through the steps to follow 
and will provide you with small snippets to get started.



Installation
------------

skillNer can be installed through the *python package-manager* pip by running the command
::

  $ pip install skillNer


Also, you need to install `spacy <https://spacy.io/>`_ so that to use some of its modules.

::

  $ pip install spacy


.. note::

    Thanks to its modular nature, you can customize the behavior of skillNer just 
    by tuning | pluging | unpluging modules. Don't worry about that, we will get into it later! 



Quickstart
----------

With these initial steps being accomplished, 
let's dive a bit deeper into skillNer through a worked example.


Let's say you want to extract skills from the following job posting:
*"You are a Python developer with a solid experience in web development
and can manage projects. You quickly adapt to a new environment 
and speak fluently English and French"*


 
1. We start first by importing modules, particularly spacy and SkillExtractor. 
Note that if you are using skillNer for the first time, it might take a while to download **SKILL_DB**.

**SKILL_DB** is skillNer default skills database. It was built upon EMSI skills database (link).

.. code:: python

    # imports
    import spacy
    from spacy.matcher import PhraseMatcher

    # load default skills data base
    from skillNer.general_params import SKILL_DB
    # import skill extractor
    from skillNer.skill_extractor_class import SkillExtractor


2. Next, we load NLP object from spacy. Afterward, we initialize an instance of SkillExtractor.

.. code:: python

    # init params of skill extractor
    nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
    # init skill extractor
    skill_extractor = SkillExtractor(nlp, SKILL_DB, PhraseMatcher)


3. Lastly, we call the `.annotate` method of the instantiated object to annotate skill within the job description.

.. code:: python

    # extract skills from job_description
    job_description = """
    You are a Python developer with a solid experience in web development
    and can manage projects. You quickly adapt to a new environment 
    and speak fluently English and French
    """

    annotations = skill_extractor.annotate(job_description)


Voil√†! Now you can inspect skills by rendering the text with the annotated skills.
This can be achieved by calling the method `.describe`.



What's next?
-----------

The above snippets show a basic example of a skillNer use case.
By simply being able to extract skills from text, skillNer opens thousands of other application
from describing the market labor to constructing knowledge graphs.

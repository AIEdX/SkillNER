Welcome to skillNer's documentation!
====================================

SkillNer is an NLP package that leverage Named Entity Recognition (NER) to automatically extract 
skills and certifications from job postings and applicants' resumes.


At the core, SkillNer is a skill extractor. Yet, it unlocks tons of features, 
e.g. helps both recruiters to find the best matches for their needs and applicants learn more about the job market.

Purpose
-------

The goal of this project is to build a named entity extraction solution for skill extraction from job posting text as well as candidates' resum√©.
This brings together the market labor, recruiters, and job seekers.

We aim to build a solution that merges a rule-based matcher that labels data and feeds it
to a BERT model to fine-tune it for skills recognition.



Team
----
We started small with a team of two members, `Anas AIT AOMAR`_ and `Badr MOUFAD`_ . 
Yet, with **skillNer** being open
sourced, the team will surely get bigger and bigger.

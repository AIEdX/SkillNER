Why and How to contribute ?
-----------------------------------------

SkillNer is the first **Open Source** skill extractor. 
Hence it is a tool dedicated to the community and thereby relies on its contribution to evolve.

We did our best to adapt SkillNer for usage and fixed many of its bugs. Therefore, we believe its key features 
make it ready for a diversity of use cases.
However, it still has not reached 100% stability. SkillNer need the assistance of the community to be adapted further
and broaden its usage. 


You can contribute to SkillNer either by

- Reporting issues. Indeed, you may encounter one while you are using SkillNer. So do not hesitate to mention them in the `issue section of our GitHub repository <https://github.com/AnasAito/SkillNER/issues>`_. Also, you can use the issue as a way to suggest new features to be added.

- Pushing code to our repository through pull requests. In case you fixed an issue or wanted to extend SkillNer features.


A third (friendly) option to contribute to SkillNer will be soon released. *So, stay tuned...*
